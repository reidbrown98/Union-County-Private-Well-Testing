# Union-County-Private-Well-Testing

This is a technical report I wrote about residents in Union County and their likelihood to test their private wells for contamination. Water Quality Standards as determined by the EPA do not apply to private wells like they do for municipal water sources. As a result of this, many private well owners are potentially at risk for a plethora of contaminants in their water. This paper takes a Mental Models approach to Risk Communication and tries to determine what creates the highest likelihood in getting a well owner to test their well. Surveys were sent out to a sample of well owners across multiple counties. I researched Union County under the direction of Dr. Frank Stillo and Dr. Jacqueline MacDonald Gibson in UNC's Gilling's School of Public Health.
